# Get to know me

Hello, my name is Jared de Monteiro, and I am a Computer Scientist based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am currently a Sophomore at the University of Miami, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics.

I have a wide range of passions and hobbies that keep me busy. I love playing musical instruments like piano and guitar, playing basketball, and working out.

I have also huge passion for art, which I like to combine with my passion for tech as well. I enjoy creating things from scratch, and seeing all my work come together to make a finished product. I love working with applications like Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, and After Effects for creative projects. With my passion for creation, I have gotten into web development, using Next.js, creating sites that help people with their everyday problems.
